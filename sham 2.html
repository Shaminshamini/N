            Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.[3] Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.[3] Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.[4]The etymology of the term anime is disputed. The English word "animation" is written in Japanese katakana as „Ç¢„Éã„É°„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ (animƒìshon) and as „Ç¢„Éã„É° (anime, pronounced [a.…≤i.me] ‚ìò) in its shortened form.[12] Some sources claim that the term is derived from the French term for animation dessin anim√© ("cartoon", literally 'animated drawing'),[13] but others believe this to be a myth derived from the popularity of anime in France in the late 1970s and 1980s.[12]

            As a type of animation, anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other mediums; it is sometimes mistakenly classified as a genre itself.[7] In Japanese, the term anime is used to refer to all animated works, regardless of style or origin.[8] English-language dictionaries typically define anime (/Àà√¶n…™me…™/)[9] as "a style of Japanese animation"[10] or as "a style of animation originating in Japan".[11] Other definitions are based on origin, making production in Japan a requisite for a work to be considered "anime".[12]
